# Skip it

During this Hackaton, we had to find innovative solutions to improve the customer journey. We realized that the wait at checkout was too long which had the effect of dissuading one buyer in five. We have, therefore, imagined a mobile payment platform "SkipIt" to perform a self-check out sold to partners.

I worked with 3 students of a famous fashion school in Paris called IFM (Institut Francais de la Mode).
I had to make a simple website to illustrate the application and its goal.

## Getting Started

If you want to see the website, make sure to git clone [Skip it](https://github.com/DianeDerycke/skip_it_hackaton_ifm.git)

Run the command `open index.html`
